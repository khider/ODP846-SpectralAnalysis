# Spectral and wavelet analysis of core ODP846


One of the outstanding questions in paleoclimatology is the cause of the mid-Pleistocene transition: the changed from a 40-kyr world to a 100-kyr world about 1 million years ago. We investigate the robustness of this signal in a deep sea core from the tropical Pacific, ODP846.
